# client-prototype-design

A prototype design I made for a client who wanted me to come up with something new but at last ended up copying his competiror website.

# So what was unique about this project?
Well,the client wanted to setup a website where he could take print design orders.So I wanted to create
a system where a customer could submit his orders,sample of whats he want to make without signing up
for a smoother experience.

And of course,the design part was vital as well.
